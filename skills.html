            <h2 class="skill-title">C++: Building Powerful Solutions</h2>
            <p class="skill-description">When it comes to tackling complex problems with precision, <strong>C++</strong> is my go-to language. It’s fast, efficient, and gives you full control over your program’s performance. It’s a tool for those who want to get into the depths of <strong>computational efficiency</strong> and <strong>system-level programming</strong>. With C++, I’ve built everything from basic algorithms to game engines, and every project challenges me to think in a new, more logical way. It’s the perfect language for those who love <strong>problem-solving</strong> and <strong>optimization</strong>.</p>

            <h2 class="skill-title">The Simplicity of Visual Basic</h2>
            <p class="skill-description">Sometimes, the simplest things make the biggest impact. That’s what I love about <strong>Visual Basic</strong>. It allows me to quickly build functional applications without getting lost in complex code. With its easy-to-understand syntax, I can create custom desktop tools, automate tasks, and build small-scale applications. It’s a great starting point for anyone wanting to understand the fundamentals of programming while still being able to build useful projects right away.</p>
