        <h1>MY JOURNEY IN TECH</h1>
        <p>My journey into the world of technology began in 2023, when I joined Dedan Kimathi University of Technology to pursue a degree in Business Information Technology. Little did I know, this was the beginning of a fascinating adventure. As I dove into my studies, I developed a deep passion for programming and set out to acquire new skills that would set me apart in the ever-evolving tech landscape. I've learned to code in languages like C, C++, and Visual Basic, constantly pushing myself to understand the logic behind each line of code. But my journey doesn't stop there — I am always eager to explore and learn new programming languages, constantly expanding my skill set. Each day brings new challenges, but it's through these challenges that I grow, and the excitement of building something from scratch keeps me moving forward. This is just the beginning, and I can't wait to see where this tech journey takes me.</p>
